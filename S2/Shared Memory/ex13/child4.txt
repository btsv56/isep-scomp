lmao you fastingcels are mentally ill to the extreme

autophagy occurs as a COPING mechanism in times of stress and nutrient inadequacy and it is always occuring all of the time you're alive
growth hormone spikes during a fast are irrelevant because growth hormone competes with insulin and is a fat metabolism upregulator, both of which are anabolic but only insulin is anabolic beyond baseline levels
growth hormone merely permits growth so that even if you inject growth hormone you don't build any extra muscle but if you inject insulin you do build extra muscle, insulin tanks during a fast, so why fast?
>ketosis
a waste of time and inferior metabolic state, reason why not a single mammal is in ketosis outside the scenario of famine

why?
>The whole point of hormesis is to endure stresses to induce beneficial adaptations.
but one stress causes nutrient inadequacy, why would I do that?
some stresses are not beneficial like for example cold showers inhibiting muscle recovery
