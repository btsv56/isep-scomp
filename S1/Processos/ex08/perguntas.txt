a) Only two PIDs are listed: the parent's and one of the child's. 
This happens because the parent process is still running when the child process finishes. However, the OS can't remove the process from the process list.

b) The reason why only one of the child processes shows on the list is because the parent has a waitpid instruction for one of them. This removes it from the processes list. The other child process remains (as defunct) on the process list, which is known as a zombie process.
